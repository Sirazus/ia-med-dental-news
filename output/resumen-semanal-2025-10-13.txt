📝 Resumen:

🔹 Mental Health Starts in the Dental Chair
   Some of the clearest signs of emotional distress show up in the mouth. In the practice, we see: Teeth worn down from chronic grinding or clenching. Neglected hygiene tied to depression or trauma. Acid erosion linked to disordered eating. Missed appointments due to anxiety or shame. These aren’t just dental issues. They’re potential signs of deeper struggles.

🔹 Oral Health Starts at the Gumline: Supporting Patient Compliance at Home
   Gum health is the foundation of oral health. The gingival margin is where bacteria and plaque first accumulate. When left unchecked, this buildup can lead to gingivitis and, eventually, more serious periodontal disease. The basics of home care remain unchanged: brush twice daily, floss regularly, and use an effective mouthrinse.
